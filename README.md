# Welcome to the "Eyesome App"


### Introduction

In this project, I build a **Eyesome App** similar to Lenskart - Clone.
Eyesome App is your one-stop destination for all your eyewear needs, bringing the convenience of online shopping to the world of eyewear. Inspired by the success of Lenskart, Eyesome App offers a seamless and user-friendly e-commerce platform designed for purchasing eyewear online. Whether you're looking for stylish eyeglasses, fashionable sunglasses, Eyesome App has you covered.

This README provides essential information about Eyesome App, guiding you through its features, installation, and usage. A user looking to make the most of the app, this document serves as your comprehensive guide.

    <summary>Approach to Develop the App</summary>
<br />

- **Project Setup:**

  - Used a tool Create React App to set up a new React.js project.
  - Install the necessary dependencies, including Redux Toolkit, React Redux, React Router and other relevant packages.

- **Design and Wireframing:**

  - Started by creating wireframes or mockups for mobile app's user interface. This helped me plan the layout and design.
  - I prioritize a clean and intuitive design for small screens, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile devices.

- **Mobile-First Component Development:**

  - Developed individual React components with a mobile-first mindset. Started with the smallest screen size (e.g., mobile phones) and progressively enhance for larger screens (tablets and desktops).
  - Utilized responsive design techniques, such as CSS media queries, to adjust component layouts and styles for different screen sizes.

- **Responsive Styling:**

  - Implemented a mobile-first approach in styles by defining the default styles for mobile screens and then using media queries to apply styles for larger screens.

- **React Router for Navigation:**

  - Implemented React Router to handle navigation within the app.
  - Defined routes and route components, ensuring that the navigation flows smoothly on both small and large screens.

- **Redux Setup and State Management:**

  - Configured the Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Created slices to manage different parts of the application's state such as userSlice, CartSlice, wishlistSlice, usersListSlice, filtersSlice, productsSlice, productDetailsSlice etc.
  - Created different methods to add, remove, update, delete the different states.

- **API Integration:**

  - Used HTTP fetch method to connect the mobile app to the backend API for fetching data and performing CRUD operations.
  - Implemented Redux actions and reducers to manage the application's data flow.
  - Here in this case used fake API's to fetch the data and based on response status (pending, success, failure) implemented the locally available data to render the UI.

- **Debugging and Debug Tools:**

  - Used browser developer tools and React DevTools for debugging and inspecting component states.
  - Implemented logging and error handling to catch and handle issues gracefully.

- **Deployment:**

  - Prepared the app for deployment by configuring build scripts, optimizing assets, and setting up a production environment.
  - Choosed a hosting platform Netlify for deploying Eyesome App.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
